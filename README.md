- 👋 Hi, I’m @RogueMaven
- 👀 I’m interested in end-to-end software solutions that are easy to use by non-techy people.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, CMake, and Terminal-User-Interfaces (TUI) like Dialog, NCurses, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on crypto currency projects, especially Monero, and Ethereum based DEX/DeFi applications.
